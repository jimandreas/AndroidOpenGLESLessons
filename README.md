*Port of AndroidOpenGLESLessons folder to Android Studio*

Original Github location:  https://github.com/learnopengles/Learn-OpenGLES-Tutorials

This project is a repository for the lessons and tutorials over at http://www.learnopengles.com/

The compiled app can be downloaded from the Android market at https://market.android.com/details?id=com.learnopengles.android

## What has changed:

The samples have been reworked so that they all live happily (more or less) in one Android Studio project.
In theory you should be able to pull the repo or download the zip file, and then hand the (uncompressed) folder 
to Android Studio and everything should just build.

The copy of the Gihub repo imported into Android Studio just fine.  I added my favorite .gitnore files and then compiled it.
It was a completely clean build without changing a single line of code at the initial Git checkin tag.
Since the initial build - I have taken screenshots and built a README.md file.    Now the reading and understanding
and practice begins :sweat_smile:  - jim a
