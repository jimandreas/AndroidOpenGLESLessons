# Learn-OpenGLES-Tutorials / android / AndroidOpenGLESLessons/

*Port of AndroidOpenGLESLessons folder to Android Studio*

Original Github location:  https://github.com/learnopengles/Learn-OpenGLES-Tutorials

This project is a repository for the lessons and tutorials over at http://www.learnopengles.com/

## What has changed:

The samples have been reworked so that they all live happily (more or less) in one Android Studio project.
In theory you should be able to pull the repo or download the zip file, and then hand the (uncompressed) folder 
to Android Studio and everything should just build.

The copy of the Gihub repo imported into Android Studio just fine.  I added my favorite .gitnore files and then compiled it.
It was a completely clean build without changing a single line of code at the initial Git checkin tag.
Since the initial build - I have taken screenshots and built a README.md file.

### Changes 09-2019:

Converted the implementations in Lessons 1 through 8 to Kotlin.   The LiveWallpaper implementation
remains coded in Java.   A Kotlin conversion of these folders is left as an exercise for the developer.
Let me know if you want to pull them into this repo via a pull request.

### Changes 01-2026

With help from Claude Opus 4.5 - the build system is renovated to *.kts and
all library versions are updated.
